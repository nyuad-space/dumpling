## Errata v1 (2025)

### Hardware

- Boot1 pin floating: To boot the main MCU into DFU mode, hold down the 3rd reset button to pull Boot1 low.
- SWD TagConnect: Layout is too close to XT30 or M.2 sockets and he connector is difficult to source.
- Check and recheck DRC. Critical unconnected items may be hidden amongst the mundanes.
- Look out for "x"ed POS in the BOM file. May have been accidentally toggled off.
